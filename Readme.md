## Usage

### Installation

To use **GitHub Actions Test Logger**, follow these steps:

1. Install **GitHubActionsTestLogger** package in your test project
2. Install **Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk** package in your test project (or update to latest)
3. Modify your GitHub Actions workflow file by adding `--logger GitHubActions` to `dotnet test`:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.3

      - name: Install .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1.7.2
        with:
          dotnet-version: 5.0.x

      - name: Build & test
        run: dotnet test --configuration Release --logger GitHubActions
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that your test project references **Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk** version **16.8.0** or higher.
Older versions of this package may not work properly with custom test loggers.

> ‚ö†Ô∏è If you are using **.NET SDK v2.2 or lower**, you need to enable [`<CopyLocalLockFileAssemblies>`](https://github.com/Tyrrrz/GitHubActionsTestLogger/issues/5#issuecomment-648431667) property in your test project.

### Options

**GitHub Actions Test Logger** has a few options that you can override to customize its behavior.
In order to pass an option to the logger, include it as an additional parameter inside `--logger`:

```sh
dotnet test --logger "GitHubActions;option1=foo;option2=bar"
```

#### `format`

Specifies the format used when logging test results to the console.

The following replacement tokens are available:

- `$test` ‚Äî replaced with the display name of the test
- `$outcome` ‚Äî replaced with the error message (in case of an exception) or the outcome of the test
- `$traits.TRAIT_NAME` ‚Äî replaced with the value of a trait named `TRAIT_NAME`

Default: `$test: $outcome`.

Examples:

- `$test: $outcome` -> `MyTests.Test1: AssertionException: Expected 'true' but found 'false'`
- `[$traits.Category] $test: $outcome` -> `[UI Tests] MyTests.Test1: AssertionException: Expected 'true' but found 'false'`

#### `report-warnings`

Specifies whether to additionally report warnings for tests that have neither failed nor succeeded (i.e. skipped or inconclusive).
If disabled, only failed tests will be reported.

Can be set to either `true` or `false`.

Default: `true`.
