## Usage

### Installation

To use GitHubActionsTestLogger, follow these steps:

1. Install `GitHubActionsTestLogger` package in your test project
2. Install `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` package in your test project (or update to latest)
3. Modify your GitHub Actions workflow file by adding `--logger GitHubActions` to `dotnet test`:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.3

      - name: Install .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1.7.2
        with:
          # Note: version 3.0.x or higher is required!
          dotnet-version: 5.0.x

      - name: Build & test
        # Specify custom logger here
        run: dotnet test --configuration Release --logger GitHubActions
```

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that you are running your tests with **.NET SDK v3.0 or higher**.
Older versions of the SDK don't support custom test loggers added via NuGet packages.

‚ö†Ô∏è Ensure that your test project references `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` version `16.8.0` or higher.
Older versions of this package may not work properly with custom test loggers.

### Options

GitHubActionsTestLogger has a few options that you can override to customize its behavior.
In order to pass an option to the logger, include it as a parameter to the `--logger` option like so:

```sh
dotnet test --logger "GitHubActions;option1=foo;option2=bar"
```

Supported options:

- #### `report-warnings`

Specifies whether to report warnings for tests that have neither failed nor succeeded (i.e. skipped or inconclusive).
If disabled, only failed tests will be logged and all other tests will be ignored.
Can be either `true` or `false`.

By default this option is set to `true`.
