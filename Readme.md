âœ… **Project status: active**.

Custom logger for `dotnet test` that reports test results in a structured format that GitHub Actions understands.
When using this logger, failed tests are listed in workflow annotations and highlighted in code diffs.

## Download

- [NuGet](https://nuget.org/packages/GitHubActionsTestLogger): `dotnet add package GitHubActionsTestLogger`

## Usage

> Note: In order to use GitHubActionsTestLogger, you must be running your tests with **.NET SDK v3.0 or higher**.
If you are using `actions/setup-dotnet` in your workflow to install .NET SDK, ensure that `dotnet-version` is set to `3.0.x` or higher.
Attempting to run tests with this logger on an older version of the SDK will result in a build error.

### Installation

To use GitHubActionsTestLogger, follow these steps:

1. Install `GitHubActionsTestLogger`
2. Install `Microsoft.NET.Test.Sdk` (or update to latest version if it's already installed)
3. Modify your GitHub Actions workflow file to run tests using this logger:

```yaml
name: CI
on: [push, pull_request]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v2.3.3

      - name: Install .NET
        uses: actions/setup-dotnet@v1.7.2
        with:
          # Note: version 3.0.x or higher is required!
          dotnet-version: 5.0.x

      - name: Build & test
        # Specify custom logger to use via the `--logger` option
        run: dotnet test --configuration Release --logger GitHubActions
```
### Options

By default, GitHubActionsTestLogger produces warnings for tests that have neither failed nor succeeded (i.e. skipped or inconclusive).
If that's not desirable, you can disable this behavior with a switch:

```sh
dotnet test --logger "GitHubActions;report-warnings=false"
```
