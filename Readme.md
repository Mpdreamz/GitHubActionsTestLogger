Custom test logger for `dotnet test` that writes output in a format that GitHub Actions understands. When using this logger, failed tests show up in annotations as well as in the list of failed checks.

The implementation relies on various heuristics to get source information because .NET test runner does not provide it, even though the contract implies it should.
